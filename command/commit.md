Create a git commit (or multiple commits) for the working tree.

1. Review the working tree (staged and unstaged changes)
2. Analyze the changes and generate one or more concise, meaningful commit message
3. The commit message should focus on the "why" rather than the "what"
4. Execute the commit(s) with the generated message
5. Show the result of the commit
