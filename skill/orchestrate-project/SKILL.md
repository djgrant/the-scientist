description: When you need to orchestrate long-horizon projects, use this orchestration strategy to define, execute, review, test, and iterate on sub-tasks until the project is complete.

## Instructions

1. Prepare
  - Understand the project requirements
  - Create a master work package to hold the top-level state of the project
2. Define
  - Delegate tasks to sub-agents to find out what is involved to deliver the project
  - Instruct each agent to create its own work packages
3. Execute
  - Delegate work packages to one or more agents
  - Choose the appropriate agent for each task
  - Ask agents to commit their work when they're done.
4. Review
  - For each complete work package:
    - Delegate the review of each work package to new sub-agents
    - Ask the review agent to update the work package with its findings
5. Iterate
  - For each reviewed work package:
    - Read the results of the review stage
    - Delegate a new agent to iterate on the solution, if needed
    - Create new work packages, if needed
    - Conclude the work package, if review passed
6. Complete
